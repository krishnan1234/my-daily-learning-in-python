# Think of a variable as a name attached to a particular object. 
# In Python, variables need not be declared or defined in advance, as is the case in many other programming languages. 
# To create a variable, you just assign it a value and then start using it. 
# Assignment is done with a single equals sign (=):
# a=20
# print(a)

# Python also allows chained assignment, which makes it possible to assign the same value to several variables simultaneously:
# a=b=c = 3
# print(a,b,c)

# In many programming languages, variables are statically typed. That means a variable is initially declared to have a specific data type, and any value assigned to it during its lifetime must always have that type.

# Variables in Python are not subject to this restriction. In Python, a variable may be assigned a value of one type and then later re-assigned a value of a different type:

a=20 #int
b=3.45 #float
c="santkrish" #string
d=True #boolean
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
